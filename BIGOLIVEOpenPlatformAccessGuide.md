# BIGOLIVE Open Platform Access Guide

# 1. Bigolive Oauth2.0 Authorization Procedure

Bigolive OAuth2.0 Authorization Login allows Bigolive users to securely login to third-party applications or websites using their Bigolive credentials. After the user authorizes the third-party access through OAuth, the third-party application can obtain the user's access_token and use it to access the Bigolive user's basic information. Bigolive OAuth2.0 Authorization Login currently supports the authorization_code mode and is suitable for server-side application authorization. The overall process of this mode is as follows:

1. When a third-party initiates an OAuth login authorization request, the OAuth authorization page will be redirected to the third-party website after the user allows the third-party application to access their information, carrying a temporary authorization code parameter. 
2. By using the code parameter along with AppID, access_token can be obtained through the API. 
3. By using access_token, platform interface can be requested to obtain user basic data resources or to assist users in achieving basic operations.

The sequence diagram of access_token as follows：

# 2. Authorization Process Integration Steps

## 2.1. Preparatory Steps

### 2.1.1. Domain Address

Interface domain and API should be filled in as {{host_domain}} and replaced according to different environments.

Production environment: [oauth.bigolive.tv](http://oauth.bigolive.tv) , backup domain: [oauth.bigoapp.tv](http://oauth.bigoapp.tv)

### 2.1.2. Business Key Allocation

Bigo will allocate AppID for third-party applications, and third-party applications will provide the icon URL of the authorization page. If necessary, please contact the live broadcast platform liaison urgently to obtain it.

### 2.1.3. Required information from the business side

Please provide relevant information in advance, which includes redirection authorization and display of authorization page information, including:

| **Field**    | **Description**                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| app_icon     | Display the third-party app icon on the authorization  page, and it is recommended that the size should be larger than 50*50 to  ensure clarity |
| app_name     | Display the third-party app name on the authorization  page  |
| redirect_uri | After successful verification of login on Bigo Live,  redirect to the receiving address for code sending, which supports multiple  redirect_uri whitelists |

### 2.1.4. Generate private and public key

The third parties should generate the private and public key, keep the private key safely yourself, and provide the public key and algorithm(RS256 or ES256) to Bigo. 

Detail See [PART 3.1.1.](#311-step-1-generate-private-and-public-key)

You can pre-check the format of public key if is correct through [this website](https://merri.cx/enigmator/cryptanalysis/rsa_key_analysis.html).

### 2.1.5. Error code

It is specially agreed that when the HTTP gateway status code returns 200, normal business data processing is carried out, and the interface returns a JSON body. The specific business error code will be returned in the JSON body. If the status code is not 200, abnormal diagnosis should be carried out based on different status codes.

Gateway Error Codes as follows:

| **Gateway code** | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 200              | Normal, specific business processing can be carried out      |
| 405              | Request method does not exist                                |
| 401              | The token is invalid or has expired, it is used for  interfaces that require access token request |
| 408              | Gateway rate limit                                           |
| 500              | Request parameter exception                                  |



## 2.2. Step 1: Obtain code through authorization page


### 2.2.1. Access method 1: Mobile App authorization by Bigolive App

Purpose: Generally applicable to users who have installed the Bigolive App, and 3rd has mobile app. If this method is applied and the user does not have the Bigolive App installed, they need to be guided to download it from the app store. It is recommended to use this method for access. 

Third-party app integration of Bigolive OAuth2.0 Deeplink

```python
bigolive://oauth?lang=en&state=12345&scope=openid&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Ftest-login.uho.fun%2Fd%2Fbigo.php%3FIEMI%3D8651f0e36795d692de18a50d16e80634&response_type=code&client_id=1WlQhfrwcb2Gmqa
```



### 2.1.2 Access method 2：Mobile Webite Application authorization by Bigolive App

Purpose: Generally applicable to users who have installed the Bigolive App, and 3rd has mobile website application. If this method is applied and the user does not have the Bigolive App installed, they need to be guided to download it from the app store.

Third-party mobile website integration of Bigolive OAuth2.0 Deeplink

```
bigolive://oauth
?lang=en
&state=123
&scope=openid
&response_type=code
&client_id=${ClientId}
&redirect_uri=urlencode(${TempRedirectUri})  # actual redirect uri 2nd urlencode
```

Among the params, TempRedirectUri = bigolive://web?openMode=1&url=urlencode($RedirectUri)   # actual redirect uri 1st urlencode



Example for RedirectUri = http://127.0.0.1/callback：

```
bigolive://oauth?lang=zh&state=123&client_id=1WlQhfrwcb2Gmqa&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=bigolive%3A%2F%2Fweb%3FopenMode%3D1%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252F127.0.0.1%252Fcallback
```

Note: the actual redirect uri  has been urlencoded 2 times in the slide link.

After the user clicks to confirm authorization，the actual callback address is like  http://127.0.0.1/callback?state=12345&code=dwdwr3u439r3er3kdwdw



### 2.2.3. Access method 3: Website Application

Purpose: Generally used for website applications. 

For example, Bark app with Bigolive Oauth2.0 website:

![](./img/oauth_login_example.png)


Third-party app integration page for Bigolive OAuth2.0

```
https://www.bigo.tv/oauth2/pc.html?lang=en&state=12345&scope=user_im+openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bark.us%2Fauth%2Fbigo_live%2Fcallback&response_type=code&client_id=1f744717e37e0ac
```



### 2.2.4 Parameters

| state          | string   | No           | This parameter is used to maintain the state of the  request and callback, and is returned to the third party in its original form  after authorization. This parameter can be used to prevent CSRF attacks (cross-site  request forgery attacks). It is recommended that the third party include this  parameter, which can be set to a simple random number plus session for  verification. During the transmission of the state, this parameter will be  processed as part of the URL. Therefore, it is recommended to perform URL  encoding on this parameter to prevent special characters (such as '#' and  '&') that affect URL parsing from causing the parameter to be incorrectly  returned. |
| scope          | string   | Yes          | The scope of application authorization can have  multiple scopes separated by symbols (+); for obtaining openid, add 'openid' |
| redirect_uri   | string   | Yes          | 1.uri requires authorization from the Bigo Live, must  be as same as 2.0.3 provided  2. Use urlEncode to process the link; |
| response_type  | string   | Yes          | Required as ‘Code’                                           |
| client_id      | string   | Yes          | Business unique identifier assigned by Bigolive              |

Response description:

After the user grants permission, they will be redirected to the website specified in the redirect_uri parameter, with the code and state parameters included. Example: redirect_uri?code=CODE&state=STATE 

If the user denies permission, no redirection will occur

**<font color='#dd00000'>Note: The code is valid for 60 seconds and can only be used once.</font>**



## 2.3. Step 2: Obtain access_token through code

**API:**

```python
POST  https://{{host_domain}}/sign/oauth2/token
Content-type: application/json
bigo-client-id: {{client_id}}
bigo-oauth-signature: {{calculate the sign}} 
bigo-timestamp: {{timestamp}}

{
    "code":"{{code}}",
    "grant_type":"authorization_code",
    "redirect_uri":"{{redirect_uri}}"
}
```

The access_token is used as a credential for third-party applications to access user data on the Bigo Live platform. It is important to obtain the accesstoken through backend and then return it to the client to prevent security information leakage. The validity period is usually set to 2 hours.

Response Example：

```python
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
"access_token":"MTQ0NjJkZmQ5OTM2NDE1ZTZjNGZmZjI3",
"token_type":"bearer",
"expires_in":3600,
"refresh_token":"IwOGYzYTlmM2YxOTQ5MGE3YmNmMDFkNTVk",
"scope":"openid read",
"openid":"9adjfajll11adfa",

bigo-timestamp: {{timestamp}}

{
    "grant_type":"refresh_token",
    "refresh_token":"{{refresh_token}}"
}

```

It is necessary to refresh the accesstoken through the backend before returning it to the client end to prevent the leakage of security information

#     

# 3. Server-side Signature Authentication

Signature authentication method is mainly used for identity authentication of interactions between the Bigo platform and third-party service servers. If you only use Server-side signature authentication, you can ignore step 1 to step 3 in "II. Authorization Process Integration Steps".

## 3.1. Digital Signature Algorithm

The digital signature generation method is suitable for business data-sensitive interfaces, such as payment and other APIs. Third parties can ensure the security of signatures by themselves. The public and private keys are generated by the business, and the private key is retained by the business and used to generate signatures, the public key is provided to Bigo and used to verify the signature.

The specific process is as follows:

![](./img/ss_auth.png)

Bigo only support <font color='#dd00000'>**RS256**</font>(RSA-SHA256) and <font color='#dd00000'>**ES256**</font> (ECDSA-SHA256)

**References:** 

            A.     RS256, PKCS#1 v1.5 (RSA):

https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/signature/pkcs1_v1_5.html

            B.     ES256, DSA and ECDSA:

https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/signature/dsa.html



### 3.1.1. Step 1: Generate private and public key

Firstly and once, the third parties should generate the private and public key, keep the private key safely yourself, and provide the public key and algorithm(RS256 or ES256) to Bigo. Here is a python demo for key generation with RS256, and you can get them in other way. Remind, Only support <font color='#dd00000'>**RS256 and ES256**</font>

See key-generation demo: [key-generation demo](./demo/generate_key.py)



### 3.1.2. Step 2: Sign the request data with private key

Here is rs256 and es256 python signature demos:  ([ES256 demo](./demo/es256_sign_req.py) , [RS256 demo](./demo/rs256_sign_req.py))



### 3.1.3. Step 3: Call Api with Signature

Request parameter description:

The signature is placed in the header of the http request. The specific example format is as follows: 

```python
POST https://{{host_domain}}/broom/xxx_svr_api
Content-type: application/json
bigo-client-id: {client_id}
bigo-timestamp: {timestamp}
bigo-client-version: {version}
bigo-oauth-signature: {sign}
{{postdata}}
```

**Header description：**

| **Header**           | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Content-type         | only support 'application/json‘                              |
| bigo-client-id       | Business unique identifier assigned by Bigolive              |
| bigo-oauth-signature | Authorization signature with Step 2                          |
| bigo-timestamp       | Second level timestamp                                       |
| bigo-client-version  | version of the asymmetric key. Optional, needn't to fill it. Only when you want to update the private and public keys, you can fill it with 1,2,3 or others. |

# 4. Open Platform API

## 4.0. Demo Test API

demo is using Server-side Signature Authentication.

for example, demo is assigned client_id=UP52el4VDWDqgw4 and client_secret=UPdsDSD52el4VSDSDWRDSssDWss//sasDqgw4（**developer should replace the id and secret, both of demo are not work**)

developer should test this api firstly to ensure the generation of bigo-oauth-signature is work.
